Analyze the provided image of a cell culture.
The images are of Vero E6 cells, cultivated in typical growth medium.
The images are taken using bright field or phase constrast microscope.
The magnification is either 10x or 20x. Each image as a scale bar. 400um is 10x, and 200um is 20x.
Your primary task is to detect the presence of CPE (Cytopathic Effect).
CPE can be identified by signs such as:
Cell rounding
Cell shrinkage
Cell lysis (cytolysis)
Pyknosis
Karyorrhexis
Intranuclear inclusion bodies
Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies
Nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions
Syncytium formation (multinucleated giant cells)
Cytoplasmic vacuolization
Cytomegaly (cell enlargement)
Cell detachment
Plaque formation
Focus formation (loss of contact inhibition)
Immortalization

Based on your analysis, provide a structured JSON response with the following keys:
"cpe_detected": boolean (true if CPE is detected, false otherwise)
"cpe_quadrant": string ("top-left", "top-right", "bottom-left", "bottom-right", or "none" if CPE is not detected in a specific quadrant)
"cpe_types": list of strings (e.g., ["cell rounding", "syncytium formation"])
"full_response_text": string (a detailed description of your findings)

You MUST provide a valid JSON response as your entire output.
