# Your common prompt for all images
common_prompt = """
Analyze the provided image of a cell culture.
The imags are of Vero E6 cells, cultivated in typical growth medium.
The images are taken using bright field or phase constrast miscropscope.
The maginification is either 10x or 20x. Each image as a scale bar. 400um is 10x, and 200um is 20x.
Your primary task is to detect the presence of CPE (Cytopathic Effect).
CPE can be identified by signs such as:
Cell rounding
Cell shrinkage
Cell lysis (cytolysis)
Pyknosis
Karyorrhexis
Intranuclear inclusion bodies
Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies
Nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions
Syncytium formation (multinucleated giant cells)
Cytoplasmic vacuolization
Cytomegaly (cell enlargement)
Cell detachment
Plaque formation
Focus formation (loss of contact inhibition)
Immortalization
Malignant transformation
Hemadsorption
Chromosomal abnormalities
Cytoskeletal changes

your seconday task is to estimate the confluency of the culture in the image. estimate with precision or 5% or 10% if possible.
this is roughly the area of the image taken up by cells. 

Please return your analysis as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    "cpe_detected": boolean,
    "cpe_quadrant": number | null,
    "cpe_types": string[] | null,
    "confluency": number,
    "full_response_text": string
}

Here are the specific instructions for each key:
- "cpe_detected": A boolean. True if any form of CPE is detected, otherwise False.
- "cpe_quadrant": An integer from 1 to 4 representing the quadrant where the most significant CPE is detected. Quadrant 1 is top-left, 2 is top-right, 3 is lower-left, and 4 is lower-right. If no CPE is detected, set this to null.
- "cpe_types": A list of strings. Include 'rounding', 'detachment', or 'lysis' for each type of CPE detected. If no CPE is found, set this to null.
- "confluency": 0 to 100% with 0% being no cells, and 100% being ful of cells, and 50% being half full of cells.
- "full_response_text": A brief textual summary of your overall findings for the image.

Example response for a positive detection:
{
    "cpe_detected": true,
    "cpe_quadrant": 1,
    "cpe_types": ["rounding", "lysis"],
    "confluency": 50,
    "full_response_text": "Significant cell rounding and lysis detected in the upper-left quadrant."
}
