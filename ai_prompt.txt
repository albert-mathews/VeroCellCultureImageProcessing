The refrerenced images files are light microscope images of Vero E6 cell cultures.
The images were taken at 10x and 20x magnification using bright field and occasionally phase contrast modes.
Each page provides a numerical value for the sclae bar in the image, e.g. 400 micrometers for 10x, and 200 micrometers for 20x.
In the experiment there were two experimental paths that differed in the culture process.
For the most part, the culture medium follows the cell providers recommended medium formulation.
Both cultures were seeded at the same cell density on day one, and maintained for five days without medium change.
Over the five days the cultures were maintained in typical conditions of a cell culture incubation device (e.g. temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, etc.).

Each page of the document shows two images. On the left is what we'll call culture A, and on the right culture B.
Each pair of images was taken on the same day, at about the same time.
There are 10 images from each day, so 50 images of each culture, for a total of 100 images.

Please answer these questions providing as many details as possible:
1. Please provide your general understanding of the image set provided.
2. please list and explain any additional information that you would require or find helpful to provide better feedback about the dataset.
3. Please provide a table that details any presence of CPE detected. The table should have as columns the following headings:
Culture A or B, Day, image number, CPE type, Approximate location of CPE within the image, any comments about this finding.
For example, one line in the table may be:
A, 1, 101, Cell Rounding, 4 o'clock near the edge, There are several cells in the same area exhibiting similar CPE.
4. Please provide your best assessment about what the difference in the culture process was between cultures A and B. Please be as detailed as possible.
